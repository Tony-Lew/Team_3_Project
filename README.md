## Project Overview
- Our selected topic is to analyze Citi Bike System data to determine popularity of bikes. 
- The reason for the selected topic is to use machine learning to easily detect trends. 
- The data source is CitiBike trip data that inclues trip ride history such as ride id, latitude/longitude, member status, ride type, station information, and time details. 
- We hope the data answers the queston if classic or electric bikes are more popular among members, non-members, and casual riders.
- The data exploration phase of the project is determing if a machine learning model will answer our question. 
- The data analysis phase of this project is testing different parts of our data to see if we can see any trends.

## Communication Protocols 
The communication protocols for the group will be to meet after class times, one additional time outside of class, and keep up daily communication as needed via Slack.

## Data Source 
The chosen data file is too large to be uploaded into github. Team members are able to access data source by doing the following :
1. Clicking the following link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html .
2. Finding the data source named " 202111-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip", date modified "Apr 7th 2022, 12:18:06 pm" 
3. Downloading the data source onto their computer/laptop.

## Database
Possible database to consider 'SQLite'(no application needed) or 'R'
